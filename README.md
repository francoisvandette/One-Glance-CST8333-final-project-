# One Glance

A web app that allows users to view multiple RSS feeds and monitor weather for multiple locations all on one screen that refreshes at user specified intervals.

My final project for CST8333 Programming Language Research Project. For this class, I am learning how to use JavaScript.

Weather information and location searching is done using OpenWeather APIs. The user can search using a location name and an OpenWeather API returns any matching locations.

RSS feeds must be acquired by the user. 

Weather and RSS feed information, as well as widget positions, is stored in the browser.
